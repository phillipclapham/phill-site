**Note**: This is not instruction. It is transmission.

If it resonates, let it ripple through you. If not, let it pass like wind through reeds.

There is nothing to do. And somehow, in that not-doing—practice unfolds.

## **Before Words**

**What Is This?**

Not something to gain. Not something to become. Not even something to recognize.
No seeker, no sought. Nothing separate.

**Completeness**

Reading happens. Words appear. Understanding unfolds. No reader behind the reading. No understanding separate from understood.

**Thinking Happening**

Thoughts arise, change, dissolve. Like clouds forming and dispersing. No cloudless sky behind clouds. No awareness behind thoughts. Just this flowing happening.

**The Sound of One Hand**

An ancient teacher was asked: "Does a dog have Buddha-nature?" He replied: "Mu."

Mu points beyond yes and no. Mu dissolves the question and questioner together. No gate, no one passing through, no other side.

**Simple Sitting**

The body settles. Eyes rest slightly open or closed. Breathing happens. Thinking occurs.

No meditator, no meditation. No one present, no presence. Just sitting.

**Beginning**

Five minutes of sitting happens. No achievement, no achiever. No maintenance, no maintainer. Nothing lacking, nothing extra.

The only seeming obstacle is the belief that there is something to attain or someone to attain it.

## **Mu**

*Just this.*
*Complete.*
*Seamless.*
*Whole.*

**Mu**

No experience appearing to anyone. No division between inside and outside.

* Aware-ing without someone being aware
* Experiencing without experiencer
* Effort-less because no one making effort
* Judge-less because no separate judge
* When resistance happens: that too is undivided reality

This wordless questioning dissolves questioning itself. Neither question nor answer—just opening.

**How Practice Unfolds**

Expression happens as:
**Moments**: The illusion of separate doer dissolves.
**Sitting**: Body sits.
**Attending**: Activity without division between doing and doer.
**Openness**: Life living itself.

All are gateless gates with no one entering.

**When Sitting Happens**

* Posture stabilizes itself
* Back aligns without aligner
* Thoughts come and go without watcher
* No beginner, no ender

No special conditions needed—conditions arise as part of this wholeness.

**Essence**

No world, no someone. No arrival, no destination. Mu.
