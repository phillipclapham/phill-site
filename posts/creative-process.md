I write nothing.

This isn't modesty or metaphor. When a poem arrives, there's no one writing—just words emerging from silence, arranging themselves on the page like iron filings around a magnet I cannot see.

The old idea of "self-expression" assumes there's a self to express from. But to write from illusion is to make shadows of shadows. Instead, this body becomes a flute. Reality breathes through it. What emerges as poetry was already there, waiting in the silence between words.

The paradox: only a self can hold the pen, yet the deepest poetry comes when that self dissolves. The vessel must be present to get out of the way.

My practice isn't meditation as accumulation—sitting to gain insight, wisdom, states. It's contemplation as subtraction. Each morning, shedding what I think I know. Each evening, losing what I've gathered. Like whittling wood, except I'm whittling away the whittler.

Most seek to gain something daily.
I seek to lose something—
especially whatever blocks the flow.

Every word contains all words. Each poem holds every poem never written. In the space between syllables, infinite possibilities rest. The deepest poetry doesn't express one thing—it expresses everything through the lens of one particular moment.

When walking, a line arrives.
When sitting, an image appears.
Not created. Discovered.
Like fossils already in the rock.

Reality knowing itself through the limits of language. Finding, somehow, perfection in the breaking of waves against the shore of what cannot be said.
