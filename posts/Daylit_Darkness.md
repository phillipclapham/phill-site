# Daylit Darkness

Imbued with deep joyful shadow,
Hold a wisp of dark cloud
in hand, control it with no mind.

Within cloud, dwell in the sky within the sky—
the overcast graveyard
of sadness, faded to a spot-lit silhouette.

From high in daylit darkness,
Release the driving rain
to cleanse the minds of dreamers—
wash away the burdens of identity.
No one needs the weight of “I.”

Dreamers awake! The rain falls now,
dark cloud dispersed by wicked wind—
the sky stretches lightly, weightless and unknown.
What remains but shadows
dancing in the wake of forgotten names?
The daylit darkness is a gift,
a reminder of the light
that shines through even the heaviest clouds.
