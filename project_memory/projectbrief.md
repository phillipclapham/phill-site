# Poetry-Focused Creative Website with Journal System

## Project Essence
Single-file HTML website transformed from tech/philosophy focus to poetry-focused creative site, embodying wu wei principles and energetic economy, featuring a functional journal system built with minimal interference.

## Core Philosophy
Every element must justify its energy through utility, friction reduction, or function amplification. The site whispers its function while remaining perfectly understood.

## Architecture
- **Single-file structure**: All content in `index.html` with embedded CSS/JS
- **Poetry aesthetic**: Light theme, Baskerville/Georgia serif for content, system sans-serif for navigation
- **Color palette**: Sage green (#7d8471) and earth brown (#a67c52) accents on light background (#fafafa)
- **Hash-based routing**: GitHub Pages compatible URLs (`#journal`, `#blog-post-slug`)
- **Build system**: Node.js processes markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **No external dependencies**: Self-contained except Google Fonts

## Current State
- ✅ **Complete poetry site transformation**: From tech/philosophy to creative poetry focus
- ✅ **Visual redesign**: Light, spacious aesthetic with serif typography for poetry content
- ✅ **Content transformation**: All sections rewritten for poetry/creative focus
  - Home → Featured poem with poetic intro
  - About → Creative/poetic biography
  - Work/Portfolio → Poetry collection showcase
  - Philosophy → Poetic philosophy on stillness and emergence
  - Blog → Creative Journal with contemplative writing
  - Contact → Poetry-focused inquiries
- ✅ **Journal system**: Fully functional with "Creative Journal" branding throughout
- ✅ **Build system updated**: Generates "journal" navigation and "Creative Journal" titles consistently
  - Build script fixed to correctly inject journal navigation after philosophy section
  - Journal navigation now appears consistently in menu
- ✅ **Matrix effects removed**: Clean, minimal aesthetic without terminal styling
- ✅ **Wu wei section archived**: Content preserved in `/drafts/wuwei-page.md`, navigation streamlined
- ✅ **Single journal navigation**: No more blog/journal duplication issues
- ✅ **Navigation typography refined**: System sans-serif fonts for cleaner, less technical appearance
- ✅ **Console errors resolved**: Removed all matrix effect code and references
- ✅ **Poetry formatting system**: Line breaks preserved with `.prettierignore` and `white-space: pre-wrap`
- ✅ **Complete poetry collection**: 18 poems (i-xviii) with sequential roman numerals, optimal reading order
  - Curated collection from poetry_page.md with themes from gentle observation to mortality
  - All formatting preserved with exact line breaks and spacing

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
- **Build**: Node.js with marked + gray-matter
- **Posts**: Markdown files in `/posts` directory
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Domain**: phillipclapham.com

## Design Principles Applied
- Function is sovereign - journal system serves poetry and contemplative writing without ornament
- Invisible is ideal - navigation and filtering feel natural, content takes center stage
- Compression is power - single-file architecture eliminates dependencies
- Elegance emerges - light, spacious aesthetic allows poetry to breathe
- Poetry as primary - serif typography and preserved line breaks honor the poetic form

## Wu Wei Implementation
The transformation emerged through precise attention to what the site wanted to become. Rather than forcing a complete rebuild, we allowed the existing architecture to evolve naturally - changing only what needed to change while preserving what served the new purpose. The journal system flows from the same markdown foundation, but now serves contemplative writing rather than technical posts.

## Transformation Approach
The site transformation embodied wu wei principles:

**What was removed**: Matrix effects, dark terminal styling, tech-focused content, wu wei navigation/page (archived to drafts), easter eggs that didn't serve the new purpose

**What was preserved**: Single-file architecture, hash-based routing, build system

**What evolved**: Visual design (dark→light), typography (mono→serif for content), navigation (blog→journal), content focus (tech→poetry)

**Key insight**: The existing foundation was already elegant - it just needed to serve a different purpose. The transformation honored the site's essential structure while allowing new content to breathe.
