**Poetry Page Content - Optimal Reading Order**

**viii**

```
rain washed away
the road home

a chance
to wander
someplace new
```

**xxxiii**

```
in the place
between
awake and asleep
resting
half in dream

let the world
rush towards the day

sunbeam on my face
```

**x**

```
I passed a traveler
on the lonely valley path

He did not say hello

I liked him
I wonder if he will

travel this way again?
```

**vii**

```
I watch the people
on this street

the crowd—
crooked river

my face disappears
in its waves
```

**ix**

```
long walk
then
falling rain upon the woods
was exactly
the music
this nap called for
```

**xiii**

```
kitten
fearless
kung fu master

laughter rises
from the belly
```

**xxix**

```
old dog
breaking wind
promises
no unwanted guests
linger long
in this home
```

**iv**

```
when I dance
in the dark
the night
grows quiet

falling disarmed
becoming

nothing
with the warm wind
```

**xiv**

```
skin meeting skin
the taste of
this sweat
is sweet

lost
in the dark
twisting
dance

renew
```

**xxv**

```
some days
no words come

empty page

no pen
the best poetry
```

**xi**

```
how beautiful to watch
the hawk plummet

terror
somewhere below

the hawk does not care
```

**xxvii**

```
in the shade
of the oak grove

ant toiling
without
ever knowing sun

never
to cast shadow

come fall—
she will meet
her end
```

**xxviii**

```
storm in the night

the mother eagle
shields her chicks

they are hungry
but dry

the wind threatens
to strip them from nest

morning
half empty
```

**xxi**

```
Buzzards often
gather here

Death comes easy
to those who walk
this way

There are many temples
along this road

lonely,
but still standing
```

**xxx**

```
dark graveyard
the earth here is mud
soaked by yesterday's rain

my feet sink as I walk

yet the stars
are the only light I need
to dance on my grave

some flowers
only blossom in mire
and moonlight
```

**xix**

```
the traveler
rushes his way
home

at sunset

they watch him
passing
from the train

until he
disappears.
```

**xxxv**

```
the traveler
loses their way
on straight paths
through the city

many strangers
rushing nowhere

no steps hasten
towards home—
the smell of fire
hangs in the evening air
```

**xxxvi**

```
dark cloud
horizon of rolling hills,
thunder crashing
across dry plain

the feel of rain
heavy
in afternoon

yet the grass here
only touched
by wind and lightning
bringing fire
```
