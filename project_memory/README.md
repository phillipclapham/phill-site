# Project Memory - Personal Website

Navigation index for Phillip Clapham's personal website project.

## Core Files

- **[projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md)** - Project essence, architecture, and current state
- **[decisions.md](./decisions.md)** - Key design decisions and reasoning
- **[next_steps.md](./next_steps.md)** - Immediate tasks and potential enhancements

## Project Context

This is a single-file HTML website embodying wu wei principles and energetic economy. The site features a functional blog system that processes markdown files into embedded HTML with minimal client-side routing.

## Memory Principles Applied

- **Cognitive economy**: Essential structure only, no semantic bloat
- **Wu wei**: Documentation emerges from actual project needs
- **Energetic efficiency**: Every documented element justifies its cognitive cost
- **Functional clarity**: Structure serves continuation and understanding

## Quick Reference

- **Codebase**: Single `index.html` file with embedded CSS/JS
- **Content**: Markdown files in `/posts` directory
- **Build**: `npm run build` processes posts and updates HTML
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages at phillipclapham.com
- **Current status**: Core functionality complete, minor spacing fix pending

## Session Continuity

Use `/wuwei` command to auto-review project memory and continue work based on current context and priorities outlined in `next_steps.md`.
