# phillipclapham.com Redesign Plan

**Created:** Feb 4, 2026
**Purpose:** Complete redesign to remove Protocol Memory dependency and establish unified personal identity hub
**Execution:** Fresh conversation with this document as context

---

## Vision Statement

**phillipclapham.com is the holistic Phill** - mad scientist, poet, political voice, builder, philosopher. All aspects unified into a coherent identity. Not a sanitized professional presence, but the full person.

**Primary Goal:** Visitors understand WHO Phill is.

**Tagline:** "The rayguns work."
**Grounding:** "Making impossible possible since 1996."

**Tone:** Perfect balance between "professional with personality" and "full mad scientist" - clearly unconventional but not alienating to professional contacts.

## Page-by-Page Content Plan

### HOME (index.html)

**Hero Section:**
```
PHILLIP CLAPHAM

The rayguns work.

[Cognitive pulse animation - keep existing]
```

**Below the Fold - Substantial Content:**
The home page should provide the most important info upfront so no clicks needed. Think of it as the "executive summary" of Phill.

1. **Quick Identity Statement**
   - One paragraph: Who is this person? (Mad scientist, builder, poet, troublemaker)
   - Current roles: Senior Solutions Architect @ Pressable, Founder @ Clapham Digital

2. **The Lab Preview** (3-4 featured experiments)
   - RAYGUN OS - cognitive resistance toolkit → links to /lab and raygunos.com
   - Third Mind - human-AI partnership framework → links to /lab
   - Clapham Digital Apps - casino training tools → links to /lab
   - Each as a card with brief description

3. **Latest/Featured** (optional)
   - Could feature a recent piece of writing or current focus
   - Or skip if too much maintenance

4. **Quick Links Row**
   - Visual links to: About | Lab | Writing | Poetry | Connect

**Footer:**
- Keep Game of Life animation
- Keep "Making impossible possible since 1996"
- Remove "Powered by Protocol Memory"
- Keep Founder Mode toggle (but inverted - see Technical section)

---

### ABOUT (/about)

**Narrative Approach:** Follow RAYGUN OS Origin page structure - personal memoir, chronological, "the experiment" framing.

**Sections:**

1. **The Short Version**
   - Quick bio for skimmers (2-3 sentences)
   - Current: Senior Solutions Architect at Pressable, Founder of Clapham Digital LLC
   - Ohio-based, making impossible possible since 1996

2. **The Accidental Mad Scientist** (early years)
   - How the brain works differently
   - Pattern recognition, systems thinking
   - "I wasn't failing at discipline. I was succeeding at something else."

3. **The Professional Arc**
   - Career journey (brief)
   - Pressable role
   - The thread connecting it all

4. **The Health Constraint** (MCAS)
   - Vulnerability about health challenges
   - How constraints became design material (kintsugi/wabi-sabi)
   - "Constraints shape the work"
   - Timeline reality without being morbid

5. **The Philosophy**
   - First principles thinking
   - Partnership over hierarchy (Third Mind approach)
   - "Everything is infrastructure"
   - The mad scientist ethos

6. **Current Experiment**
   - What's active now
   - Where energy is going
   - Invitation: "Your turn" / become collaborator

**Tone:** Vulnerable but not self-pitying. Confident but not arrogant. Personal but not oversharing.

---

### LAB (/lab)

**Framing:** "The Lab" - where the rayguns are built and tested.

**Organization:**

#### Active Rayguns (current experiments)

   - "Some experiments prove what NOT to build"

#### The Graveyard (optional section)

- Shows iteration, failure as data

---

### WRITING (/writing)

   - Personal/reflective

2. **Nemo Operans**
   - Brief intro to the political voice

## Technical Plan

### What to KEEP from Current Site

1. **Cognitive Pulse Animation** (header) - Keep, it's on-brand
2. **Game of Life Footer** - Keep, represents emergent complexity
3. **3D Card Tilt Effect** - Keep, feels experimental
4. **Water Ripple Click Effects** - Keep
5. **Dark/Light Theme Toggle** - Keep
6. **Founder Mode** - Keep but INVERT (see below)
7. **Console Easter Eggs** - Keep, possibly expand
8. **Plausible Analytics** - Keep

### What to CHANGE

1. **Remove Protocol Memory Dependency**
   - Delete: protocol-integration.js
   - Delete: protocol-memory.css (or refactor to standalone)
   - Remove all `#pm-*` element IDs and dynamic loading
   - All content becomes static HTML

2. **Founder Mode Inversion**
   - DEFAULT to enhanced state (what's currently "Founder Mode")
   - Toggle turns things DOWN to "normie mode"
   - Subverts expectations
   - Dark mode as default

3. **Multi-Page Architecture**
   - Current: Single page
   - New: Multiple pages with consistent navigation
   - Shared header/footer components
   - Consider: Build system? Or just shared HTML?

4. **CSS Refactor**
   - Merge protocol-memory.css and site-overrides.css into single stylesheet
   - Remove PM-specific styles
   - Keep all the good interaction styles

### Technical Decisions

- **Static HTML** - No build system needed, keeps it simple
- **Shared components** - Copy/paste header/footer to each page (simple maintenance)
- **Hosting** - Continue with GitHub Pages
- **Domain** - Keep phillipclapham.com (already configured)

---

## Design Direction

### Visual Identity

- **Primary:** Dark mode as default (lab aesthetic)
- **Accent:** Teal/cyan (keep from current)
- **Enhanced state:** Spectrum colors (current Founder Mode)
- **Typography:** Keep Michroma for name, clean sans-serif for body

### Personality Elements

- Mad scientist energy without being cosplay
- "Lab" touches without going full sci-fi
- Professional enough for work contacts
- Weird enough for "his people" to recognize

### Interactions

- Keep 3D card tilt (feels experimental)
- Keep water ripples (subtle delight)
- Keep cognitive pulse (consciousness theme)
- Keep Game of Life (emergence from simple rules)

## Content Needs (Phill to Provide/Approve)

1. **About narrative** - Can be drafted by Claude, needs Phill review
2. **Lab descriptions** - Brief descriptions for each experiment (Claude drafts, Phill reviews)
3. **Writing selection** - Which pieces to feature (Phill provides or directs)
4. **Poetry selection** - Claude reads Mire & Moonlight, proposes ~5 with rationale, Phill approves
5. **Any new social links** - Substack URL, Nemo Operans URL, etc. (Phill provides)

---

## Decisions (Finalized)

1. **Build system?** - **No. Static HTML.** Simple, no dependencies, Claude manages all pages directly. Copy/paste header/footer across pages.

2. **Writing: host content or link out?** - Mix. Featured pieces on-page, links to Nemo Operans and external content.

3. **Poetry selection** - **Claude reads Mire & Moonlight collection, proposes ~5 pieces with rationale. Phill approves/adjusts.**

4. **Contact form** - **No. Email link only.** Zero maintenance, no dependencies, friction filters low-effort contacts.

5. **Blog/Updates section?** - Not in current plan. Add later if needed.

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] Site loads with no PM API dependency ✅ (Phase 1)
- [ ] All pages accessible and functional (need about, lab, writing, poetry, connect pages)
- [x] Dark mode default, inverted Founder toggle works ✅ (Phase 1)
- [ ] Content accurately represents unified Phill identity (need full About, Lab content)
- [x] "The rayguns work" hook creates scroll motivation ✅ (Phase 1)
- [ ] Professional contacts not alienated (need review)
- [ ] "His people" recognize a kindred spirit (need review)
- [ ] Mobile responsive (need testing)
- [x] All existing cool features preserved ✅ (Phase 1)

## Execution Notes

**For the executing Claude:**

1. Read this plan fully before starting
2. Work in phases - complete each before moving to next
3. Preserve the existing cool features (pulse, Game of Life, etc.)
4. The tone is crucial - review RAYGUN OS site for reference
5. Phill reviews content before finalizing
6. Git commit at end of each phase

**Reference Sites:**
- https://raygunos.com (especially /origin)
- https://claphamdigital.com
- Current phillipclapham.com (for features to preserve)
