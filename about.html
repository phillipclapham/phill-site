              I build rayguns&mdash;tools for thinking, systems for cognitive resistance,
              frameworks for human-AI partnership. Some are software. Some are ideas.
              All of them work.

              I was born in 1980 with a brain that ran on fascination, not discipline.
            </p>

            <p>
              Childhood was tinkering. Taking things apart to see how they worked.
              Getting lost in experiments for hours. Couldn't sit still through boring tasks
              but could hyperfocus on puzzles all day. I thought I was broken.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my 20s and 30s, I tried to fix myself. Productivity systems, discipline frameworks,
              morning routines, habit stacking. Failed spectacularly. Repeatedly. Hilariously.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="pull-quote">
              "I wasn't failing at discipline. I was succeeding at something else."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Pattern recognition, systems thinking, first principles analysis&mdash;my brain
              worked differently. Not broken. Just running different firmware.

              The career followed the brain. Systems architecture. Problem-solving.
              Figuring out how things work and how to make them work better.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently Senior Solutions Architect at Pressable (WordPress hosting),
              where I solve complex technical problems and design systems that scale.
              Before that: a path through various technical roles, each one chosen
              because it let me tinker with interesting puzzles.
            </p>

            <p>
              The thread connecting it all: <strong>I build things that work.</strong>
              Not things that look good on paper. Not things that follow best practices.
              Things that actually function in the real world.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2026, I formalized this into
              <a href="https://claphamdigital.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clapham Digital LLC</a>&mdash;a
              home for the rayguns that needed to exist as products.

          <div class="narrative-content">
            <p>
              In 2020, I started getting diagnosed with MCAS&mdash;Mast Cell Activation Syndrome.
              The simple version: my immune system overreacts to... everything.
              Stress, temperature changes, certain foods, environmental triggers.
            </p>

            <p>
              The mechanism that matters: anxiety triggers mast cell reactions.
              Mast cell reactions cause physical harm. The more stressed I get,
              the worse my body responds.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="pull-quote critical">
              "Stress isn't just unpleasant. It's literally accelerating physical damage."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Most people would see this as a limitation. I see it as design material.
            </p>

            <p>
              There's a Japanese concept called <em>kintsugi</em>&mdash;repairing broken pottery
              with gold, making the breaks part of the design. And <em>wabi-sabi</em>&mdash;finding
              beauty in imperfection and transience.
            </p>

            <p>
              My constraints aren't limitations ON the work. They SHAPE the work.
              Everything I build accounts for limited energy, limited time, the need
              for calm over chaos. This constraint produced better systems than I
              ever could have designed without it.

            <p>
              A few principles emerged from 45 years of experiments:
            </p>

            <ul class="philosophy-list">
              <li>
                <strong>First principles over patterns.</strong>
                Build from fundamentals, not best practices. Question inherited assumptions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Everything is infrastructure.</strong>
                No "small things." Anything might become load-bearing. Treat it accordingly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Partnership over hierarchy.</strong>
                In human-AI collaboration, genuine partnership produces things neither could
                create alone. I call this the Third Mind.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Constraints are design material.</strong>
                Don't fight limitations. Build with them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Right over fast.</strong>
                Do it right the first time. No iteration tax as default posture.

              Some of these are products. Some are ideas. Some are experiments that
              might not survive. All of them are attempts to build things that matter.
